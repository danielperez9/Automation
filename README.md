# File_Organizer
automating activites of tedious things to do manually.
This is a project that was sggested, I have scripted a way to locate several files by date, they will be copied over into a new directory (same location but new folder).
The files will be renamed with the name( ou get to type in) of the folder and the date it was made.
You are able to modify it to search in differnt locations and to work with differnt ytpes of files, currently with the script now it works with txt files. 
There is also as section in he script in which you can add or delete to edit text documents, ther were a few methods of cleaning up the code but got a few errors when it came ot renaming. I hope this is useful.

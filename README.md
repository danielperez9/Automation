# File_Organizer
Automating activites of tedious things to do manually, such as sorting through files

The purpose of the project was to be abe to sort large amount of files that is collected from large quantites of data. Then to be able to recollect data (files) based on date.

The main branch hold completeed scripts one version includes code to edit the file, the other does not edit the file contents.
The other branches contain simpler versions of smaller iterations of the different parts to build the final product.

A new addition that will be coming soon is a visual representation of the data that is being sorted or collected.
